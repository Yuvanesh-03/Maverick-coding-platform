2. Deploy the rules to your Firebase project:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### 4. Build and Run

## Key Files Modified

### Core Fixes

## Troubleshooting

### PDF Generation Issues
If you still encounter PDF issues:
1. Clear browser cache and reload
2. Check console for specific error messages
3. Try using "Basic Report" first, then "Enhanced Report"

### Firebase Permission Issues
If you get permission errors:
1. Ensure you're logged in as an authenticated user
2. Check that your user document has the correct role field
3. Verify Firebase security rules are deployed

### Theme Issues
If dark/light mode doesn't work:
1. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
2. Refresh the page
3. Check browser developer tools for console errors

## Development Tips

### PDF Report Customization
The enhanced report generator (`utils/enhancedReportGenerator.ts`) uses a class-based approach:
- Modify colors in the `colors` object
- Add new sections by creating new methods
- Customize layout by adjusting margins and spacing

### Adding New Report Types
1. Create new methods in `EnhancedReportGenerator` class
2. Export convenience functions at the bottom of the file
3. Import and use in your components

### Firebase Security Rules
The rules support:
- User-specific data access
- Admin role-based access
- Public read access for appropriate collections
- Proper hackathon registration permissions

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and working on:
- Chrome 120+
- Firefox 120+
- Safari 17+
- Edge 120+

## Performance Notes

- PDF generation is done client-side and may take a few seconds for large reports
- Enhanced reports include more styling and take slightly longer to generate
- Firebase queries are optimized with proper indexing

## Support

If you encounter issues not covered here:
1. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify your Firebase configuration
3. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
4. Try clearing browser cache and localStorage
